Competition Pattern is 5 generations of:

My implementation is as follows:
	Take the world, and scan each row downwards sequentially.
	On each row, if the cell is alive, play the note associated with that column.
	The note is calculated by its offset from the middle cell, the middle cell (left middle if even) being C5, offset is in semi-tones.
	Each generation, keep a record of the empty rows.
	If three rows sequentially in a generation are empty, don't leave an empty noise for the third one.
	After all the rows are converted to sound, leave an empty noise, and generate the next generation.
